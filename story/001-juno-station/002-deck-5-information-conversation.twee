$playerFirstName walks up to the booth. Behind the glass the attendant takes notice, with apparent disdain. They tug out their headphones and regard them in a monotone.

They sink back in their chair. @@.npc;"Of course you are."@@ they mutter.

They bring up a hologram of the station, showing a cross-section of each of the seven decks. Each one lit up as they gave their spiel about each.

@@.npc;
"Okay, if you’re just here to grab a bounty, head up to ''Deck 7''. The Kiosk is fully automated now. You can also get the Board installed on a Slate or Augment so you can pick them up away from a station.

"If you need a caravan, there’s a posting board on ''Deck 6''. If you wait until quiet hours are over usually it refreshes with a new crop of people looking to fill out their groups. You can also check this floor, since sometimes groups will ‘recruit’ in the Mess.

"If you’ve got actual business with the PB3, then you’ll want their office on ''Deck 3''. Check the info booth there to get an appointment."

$playerFirstName's Augment flickers back on again, causing them to recoil a bit insurprise. Their Starchaser Acceptance Letter flashes up, with a particular line of text highlighted: @@.aug;"Please report to a PB3 office for initial training and registration."@@ They wave away the email while attempting to keep the AugComm up. It only lasts a few seconds before flickering away again. 

@@.npc;"That all?"@@ the attendant asks, fidgeting with their headphones.

@@.npc;"Quiet hours. Most folks are getting some sleep right now."@@

@@.pc;"Oh."@@ $playerFirstName replies.

@@.npc;"Yup."@@ they bring up a display on their Slate, then dismiss it as quickly. @@.npc;"It’s about 5 hours until things start back up again. Might want to sync your—"@@ they eye the newbie Starchaser up and down @@.npc;"—whatever, with the local time if you’re gonna be here a bit."@@

@@.npc;"I dunno, buddy."@@ they shrug. @@.npc;"It’s quiet hours now, so not much is open on this Deck. Deck 6 has more stuff if you have //saucier// tastes. And Deck 7 has some parks."@@

They bring up a hologram view of the station, each Deck highlighting as they talk about it. 

@@.npc;"Deck 4,"@@ they continue with a sigh. @@.npc;"It’s mainly sleeping quarters, so you can spend some Sols for a warm bed and come back when more things are open. Decks 3 and below is Administration, Residential, and Engineering. Unless you live here, you probably don’t want those."@@
