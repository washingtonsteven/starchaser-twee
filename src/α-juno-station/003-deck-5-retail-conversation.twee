@@.mora;"I'm //fine//."@@ she practically snarls. @@.mora;"Ugh, thisâ€¦is not how I expected tonight to play out."@@

Rolling off the bench, she lands on the ground on all fours. She is wearing a black flight jacket covered in various patches and pins. 

@@.mora;"And what are you doing here?"@@ They look up at $playerFirstName with a stone-faced look, which is immediately interrupted by a violent hiccup. She brings a paw to her mouth, waiting for a followup event that never came.

As the pair walk to the far end of the station, the lights in the repetetive halls shutter on and off, a rhythm of soft clicks accompanying the echo of footfalls. They exchange names, and she introduces herself as @@.name;Mora Evelu@@, Captain of the //Thylacine Harpy// Caravan.

@@.pc;"I've heard of caravans."@@ $playerFirstName piped up. @@.pc;"They cover them in the training manuals, but not in very much detail."@@

@@.mora;"Well, they wouldn't. Purely unofficial business."@@ She looks around, as if someone would have been watching them. @@.mora;"But the Board doesn't look where they don't have to, if you catch my meaning."@@

$playerFirstName nods. @@.name;Mora@@ continues.

@@.mora;"If you're new, I highly suggest getting in good with one. Unless you //want// to take a string to trashbos

@@.mora;"Nothing."@@ she shrugs. @@.mora;"Check up on Deck 6 in the morning and there will be a fresh crop of caravans with a spot or two."

$playerFirstName cocks their head. @@.pc;"Wait, 'full'?"@@

She nods. @@.mora;"It's a business out there, kid. The pot can only get split so many ways."@@ she backs up into the airlock, shrugging her shoulder to press a button on her collar. In a flash, an exosuit forms around her, an opaque, spherical helmet enclosing over her head. Her voice rings out through a tinny onboard speaker. @@.mora;"No hard feelings, kid. Just remember, Deck 6."@@

$playerFirstName tries to wave goodbye, but the airlock doors shut too quickly. With a shrug, they turn down a hall toward the center of the station.
